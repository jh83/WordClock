Some time ago i decided to build my own "WordClock". The hardware consists of:

- ESP8266, as the "brain". Wifi and NTP connected and hosts a web page that is used to configure time zone, NTP sync frequency, led strength and other things.
- ~~WS2812 LED strip cut to size to form a 14x10 matrix.~~ Custom made WS2813 LED panel (replaced the previous ws2812 strip due to dead led).
- Lasercut 3mm plywood.
- Mahogny frame. Cut from a bigger piece of wood and made into a frame.

I've used my home-built 40Watt laser cutter to cut out
